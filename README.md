This file introduces how to compile and run the program for project track two. 

## Usage 
To compile and run: python3 main.py

To use: 

\********************************************

A DB++ Group Product.

\********************************************

SELECT \<some attributes> \<enter>

FROM \<some tables> \<enter>

WHERE \<some conditions> \<enter>

Note that all of our .csv tables should be stored into the database folder, so 
that at the beginning of our program, we can read and store all the .csv files 
into dataframe for further use. 

Also note that there are some conventions when using our program: 

1. Rename format: 
FROM movies M1, movies M2

2. Put " " between every string 

3. LIKE format:
LIKE "%Harry Potter%" for example

4. Need spaces between every parentheses

Thanks!
